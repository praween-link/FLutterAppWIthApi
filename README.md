## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application that follows the
[simple app state management
tutorial](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/simple).

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,

## Assets

include with your application.

The `assets/images` directory contains [resolution-aware

## Localization

This project generates localized messages based on arb files found in
the `lib/src/localization` directory.
